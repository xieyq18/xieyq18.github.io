## Research Experience
<font size = 2> **Seat Preference with Dynamic Surcharge** 

*June, 2020 - Present.   Advisor: Prof. Zizhuo Wang, School of Data Science, CUHK*

We consider a revenue management problem arising from airline seat selection fees: passengers with seat preference are charged surcharge.
The new feature of our problem is that customers arrive with request for itinerary, 
seat preference and the willingness to pay compared with surcharge.
Consistent with practice, the seller needs to determine the opening of itineraries,
set surcharges for opening itineraries and then make decisions for arriving requests. 

We build a modified network revenue management model for this problem.
We first study a static problem and its properties related to capacity matrix. Then we extend some classical and popular policies to the dynamic problem.
We consider bid-price control policies based on the static model and the maximal sequence formulation, as well as  some surcharge-specific results.
Also, we propose an alternative setting without making opening decisions and then apply a booking limit control policy into it, achieving asymptotic optimality.
Finally, we introduce a re-solving a dynamic primal policy in the alternative setting, which achieves a uniformly bounded loss.
Numerical experiments show performance of these algorithms in different parameter settings.

**Research on Sports Scheduling** 

*May, 2019 - April, 2020. Advisor: Prof. Zhiyi Tan, School of Mathematical Sciences, ZJU*

We summarize sports scheduling research for round robin tournaments focusing on break minimization and classify it based on the opponent schedule and home-away pattern, including break's upper/lower bound estimation,
constructive scheduling in different constraints and approximation algorithms for the traveling tournament problem.

We attempted to address improve the estimation of breakâ€™s lower bound by proporties of the graph theory and regarding it as the extension of the social golf problem and Oberwolfach problem.
Moreover, we tried to prove that the latest necessary condition of the feasibility of the home-away pattern is a sufficient condition; 
on the other hand, after finding a counter-example, we proceeded to provide a stronger necessary condition by considering the column profile of home-away pattern sets.




**Audio Classification of Different Instruments**

*July, 2019 - August, 2019. Advisor: Prof. Kewei Liang, School of Mathematical Sciences, ZJU*

Group members and I learned classical classifiers such as SVM, MLP and CNN in machine learning, and some methods for extracting features
including acoustic features like MFCC, spectral flux and visual features like LBP. Based on dataset *Nsynth* programming on MATLAB,
we preprocessed audio signals, extract acoustic and visual features from mono-audio of different instruments, mainly including MFCC, spectral features and LBP.
Then we use classifiers, mainly including SVM, KNN and TREE, to train machine and classify testing set. Throughout experiments, we
compared results of different features and classifiers and concluded the best combination on this dataset.
